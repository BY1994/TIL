### 리눅스 Kconfig 문법

depends on 문법이나 select 문법으로 n 일 때 (반전) default y 선택을 하는 방법을 찾고 싶었는데 아래와 같이 !를 하거나 =n를 하면 되는 듯하다.

drivers/hwmon/Kconfig

```c
config SEORS_NTC_THERMISTOR
        tristate "NTC thermistor support from Murata"
        depends on !OF || IIO=n || IIO
        depends on THERMAL || !THERMAL_OF
        help
          This driver supports NTC thermistors sensor reading and its
          interpretation. The driver can also monitor the temperature and
          send notifications about the temperature.

          Currently, this driver supports
          NCP15WB473, NCP18WB473, NCP21WB473, NCP03WB473, NCP15WL333,
          NCP03WF104 and NCP15XH103 from Murata and B57330V2103 and
          B57891S0103 from EPCOS.

          This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
          will be called ntc-thermistor.

depends on과 select 차이

> `depends on` indicates the symbol(s) must already be positively selected (`=y`) in order for this option to be configured. For example, `depends on FB && (ZORRO || PCI)` means `FB` must have been selected, and (&&) either `ZORRO` or (||) `PCI`. For things like `make menuconfig`, this determines whether or not an option will be presented.
>
> `select` positively sets a symbol. For example, `select FB_CFB_FILLRECT` will mean `FB_CFB_FILLRECT=y`. This fulfills a potential dependency of some other config option(s). Note that the kernel docs discourage the use of this for "visible" symbols (which can be selected/deselected by the user) or for symbols that themselves have dependencies, since those *will not* be checked.
