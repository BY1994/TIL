### Cache 필요성

주 메모리를 모두 SRAM으로 만들었다면 캐시가 필요없을 수 있다. 하지만 SRAM은 비싸기 때문에 주 메모리에는 느린 DRAM을 사용할 수 밖에 없다. => 대신 캐시를 SRAM을 사용하여 만들고 고성능 메모리로 설계한다.

### ARM Cache 설명 문서

> Processors that implement the ARMv8-A Architecture are usually implemented with two or more levels of cache. This typically means that the processor has small L1 Instruction and Data caches for each core. The Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 processors are normally implemented with two or more levels of cache, that is a small L1 Instruction and Data cache and a larger, unified L2 cache, which is shared between multiple cores in a cluster. Additionally, there can be an external L3 cache as an external hardware block, shared between clusters.

위의 문서를 블로그에 깔끔하게 정리한 문서가 있었다.

### ARM Register CLIDR_EL1 (Cache 정보 확인)

아래의 레지스터를 읽으면 L1, L2, L3 캐시가 있는지 정보를 확인할 수 있다.

Ctype2, [5:3]

Indicates the type of unified instruction and data caches at level 2:

| 비트    | 설명                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `0b100` | L2 cache is implemented as a unified cache. |

### ARM HSCTLR (Cache enable)

- I, [12]

  Instruction cache enable. This is an enable bit for instruction caches at EL2:

  - `0`Instruction caches disabled at EL2. If HSCTLR.M is set to 0, instruction accesses from stage 1 of the EL2 translation regime are to Normal memory, Outer Shareable, Inner Non-cacheable, Outer Non-cacheable. This is the reset value.

  - `1`Instruction caches enabled at EL2. If HSCTLR.M is set to 0, instruction accesses from stage 1 of the EL2 translation regime are to Normal memory, Outer Shareable, Inner Write-Through, Outer Write-Through.When this bit is 0, all EL2 Normal memory instruction accesses are Non-cacheable.The reset value for this field is unknown.

- C, [2]

  Cache enable. This is an enable bit for data and unified caches at EL2:

  - `0`Data and unified caches disabled at EL2. This is the reset value.
  - `1`Data and unified caches enabled at EL2.When this bit is 0, all EL2 Normal memory data accesses and all accesses to the EL2 translation tables are Non-cacheable.The reset value for this field is unknown.

- M, [0]

  MMU enable. This is a global enable bit for the EL2 stage 1 MMU:

  - `0`EL2 stage 1 MMU disabled. This is the reset value.
  - `1`EL2 stage 1 MMU enabled.The reset value for this field is unknown.

- Configurations

  HSCTLR is architecturally mapped to AArch64 register SCTLR_EL2. See [*SCTLR_EL2, System Control Register, EL2*](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100442/0200/register-descriptions/aarch64-system-registers/sctlr-el2--system-control-register--el2?lang=en).Bit fields and details not provided in this description are architecturally defined. See the Arm Architecture Reference Manual Armv8, for Armv8-A architecture profile.
