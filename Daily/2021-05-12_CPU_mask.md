### cpumask 의미

> `Cpumasks`는 시스템에 CPU에 관한 정보를 저장하기 위해 리눅스 커널이 제공하는 특별한 방법입니다. `Cpumasks` 조작을 위한 API가 포함 된 관련 소스 코드 및 헤더 파일들은 다음과 같습니다 :

> The CPU mask is typically represented as a 32-bit bitmask. It can also be expressed as a decimal or hexadecimal number, depending on the command you are using. For example: The CPU mask for CPU 0 only is `00000000000000000000000000000001` as a bitmask, `1` as a decimal, and `0x00000001` as a hexadecimal. The CPU mask for both CPU 0 and 1 is `00000000000000000000000000000011` as a bitmask, `3` as a decimal, and `0x00000003` as a hexadecimal.

### CPU maps

> ```
> cpu_possible_mask
> ```
>
> Bitmap of possible CPUs that can ever be available in the system. This is used to allocate some boot time memory for per_cpu variables that aren’t designed to grow/shrink as CPUs are made available or removed. Once set during boot time discovery phase, the map is static, i.e no bits are added or removed anytime. Trimming it accurately for your system needs upfront can save some boot time memory.
>
> ```
> cpu_online_mask
> ```
>
> Bitmap of all CPUs currently online. Its set in `__cpu_up()` after a CPU is available for kernel scheduling and ready to receive interrupts from devices. Its cleared when a CPU is brought down using `__cpu_disable()`, before which all OS services including interrupts are migrated to another target CPU.
>
> ```
> cpu_present_mask
> ```
>
> Bitmap of CPUs currently present in the system. Not all of them may be online. When physical hotplug is processed by the relevant subsystem (e.g ACPI) can change and new bit either be added or removed from the map depending on the event is hot-add/hot-remove. There are currently no locking rules as of now. Typical usage is to init topology during boot, at which time hotplug is disabled.

mask의 의미

> **Bit masking means** selecting only certain **bits** from byte(s) that might have many **bits** set. To examine some **bits** of a byte, the byte is **bitwise** "ANDed" with a **mask** that is a number consisting of only those **bits** of interest

cpu_mask 관련 값들을 업데이트할 때 MPIDR 레지스터 값을 이용하는데, MPIDR은 Multiprocessor ID register를 의미하는 듯하다.
