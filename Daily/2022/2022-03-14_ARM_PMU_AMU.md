## 1. PMU

Performance Monitoring Unit

> The PMU provides a range of events, such as cache miss, TLB miss, CPU cycles, executed instructions, for performance profiling and debugging. The PMU can be used by performance analysis tools, such as Linux Perf, arm DS-5, and arm DS.



## 2. AMU

Activity Monitoring Unit (AMU)

> The purpose of using the AMU is for system management and monitoring, especially for power and performance management. For example, you can use AMU counters as additional CPU processor activity information for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).
